# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## About the Project

Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  You can save a task to do for each hour. It will save to local storage and appear after page refresh. Based on your current time colors of each row change based on the past, present, or future time.

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

I used the  [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times. Other resources that I used for this website are Visual Studio Code, Stack Overflow,and  W3 Schools. I could not have completed this without the help of my tutor and classmate Iyana.
