# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used the  [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and times. Other resources that I used for this website are Visual Studio Code, Stack Overflow,and  W3 Schools. I could not have completed this without the help of my tutor and classmate Iyana.
